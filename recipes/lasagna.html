    <h2>How To Make The Best Lasagna?</h2>
    <h3>Follow These Steps!</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over
      medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives,
      and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced
      garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring
      frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking
      dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta
      cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese.
      Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the
      meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for
      later.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes
      depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can
      easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top,
      and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese
      topping.
